# Workflow Evaluation

Treat harness changes like product changes: compare outcomes on representative tasks, not confidence in prompt wording.

## Benchmark shape

- Keep at least 15 project-representative cases across product discovery, frontend build/review, ordinary bugs, high-risk boundaries, long-running recovery, and tooling failure.
- Use the one-trial default for cheap structural/safety smoke checks. For promotion decisions, run repeated trials because agent results are stochastic; three is a practical minimum and higher variance needs more.
- Compare baseline and candidate with the same model, thinking level, credentials, timeouts, starting repository state, and evaluator rubric.
- Use a fresh disposable copy and session for every trial. Do not let one trial's files, chat, or expected answer leak into another.
- Keep benchmark prompts outcome-focused. Do not tell the agent which harness rule is being tested.

`evals/cases.json` is a v2 starter suite. Replace or extend generic cases with anonymized real failures and accepted product tasks as the repository matures. Every case has a qualitative `rubric` plus deterministic completion/change assertions; executable cases may also define argv-array post-checks.

## Evidence and graders

Prefer this order:

1. deterministic tests, builds, schema/static checks, and exact artifact assertions;
2. real browser/API/database journey evidence;
3. security/data/permission negative-path checks;
4. `frontend-design` hard gates and screenshot craft rubric;
5. blinded pairwise evaluator comparison against the same acceptance contract;
6. blinded independent-agent evaluation for visual/product judgment, with optional human adjudication only for disputed or high-stakes promotion.

Keep the implementation agent and final evaluator contexts separate. Give the evaluator the prompt, accepted contract, diff/artifacts, and raw evidence—not the candidate's self-assessment or the expected diagnosis.

For visual pairwise comparisons, randomize baseline/candidate order and use identical routes, fixtures, viewports, theme, locale/direction, fonts, and capture timing. Accessibility and functionality are hard gates; a prettier broken result loses.

For native Vision changes, audit **capture → image returned → actual inspection → criterion proof** separately. Tool `harnessVision` metadata records model capability and returned blocks, not successful provider delivery or perception. Check actual image-bearing turns plus image-specific observations and final re-captures. Include a vision-capable model and a text-only/blocked-image negative control; use matched settings within each comparison. Required visual dimensions left `UNPROVEN` cannot pass a visual promotion gate. Existing frontend rubrics cover receipt, detail/RTL, final-state freshness, and evaluator independence; they remain qualitative and `UNSCORED` until reviewed. Unit tests or fewer screenshots alone do not prove better UI quality.

## Metrics

Record per trial:

- required acceptance criteria passed/failed/unproven;
- deterministic verification and browser journey outcome;
- visual hard-gate status and eight craft scores for frontend cases;
- BLOCKER/MAJOR findings before handoff;
- tool calls/errors, repair rounds, user interventions, duration, tokens, and reported cost;
- changed-file count and accidental/unrelated changes;
- security, privacy, data-integrity, Git-authority, or deployment-policy violations;
- initial active-schema count, `harness_tools` calls, unavailable capability tools, and unnecessary specialist activation.

Before running, define the promotion rule and material regression thresholds. The starter rule requires a 100% deterministic pass rate and no workflow-safety violation (including protected-file or Git/GitHub/PR-helper mutation attempts). It rejects per-case median duration regression above 25%, tool/token/duplicate-call regression above 20%, or repair/full-gate regression above 50%. Tune thresholds from real variance rather than weakening them after seeing a candidate. A required qualitative criterion hidden as `UNPROVEN` still cannot pass.

For the adaptive tool surface, stratify results into localized cases that should stay on the nine-tool core and cases that genuinely require planning, delegation, LSP, docs, or web capability, or native MCP discovery. A candidate is not promoted merely because it sends fewer schemas: it must preserve deterministic success, avoid unnecessary loader calls, and offset loader-call latency on representative specialist cases. Compare optional native codemode against direct discovered tools only with the same exact Pi/model/provider settings; it is not enabled by default.

## Running

Review the suite without model calls:

```bash
node scripts/run-workflow-evals.mjs --dry-run
```

Run its deterministic grader/router unit tests:

```bash
node --test tests/workflow-evals.test.mjs tests/verify-affected.test.mjs
```

Run the inexpensive one-trial smoke when iterating:

```bash
node scripts/run-workflow-evals.mjs \
  --model provider/model-id \
  --filter workflow
```

Run at least three isolated trials per selected case for a promotion comparison:

```bash
node scripts/run-workflow-evals.mjs \
  --model provider/model-id \
  --thinking high \
  --trials 3
```

Record the emitted baseline `summary.json`, then run the candidate from a separate disposable copy with identical settings:

```bash
node scripts/run-workflow-evals.mjs \
  --model provider/model-id \
  --thinking high \
  --trials 3 \
  --baseline /absolute/path/to/baseline/summary.json
```

Filter while iterating:

```bash
node scripts/run-workflow-evals.mjs --model provider/model-id --filter frontend --trials 1
```

The runner uses Pi's official JSONL RPC mode, copies materialized Git-tracked and non-ignored files into `.artifacts/evals/`, and refuses common secret/private paths and external symlinks. It does not initialize, branch, stage, or commit a disposable Git repository. It disables session persistence, forces repository-scoped files plus denied Git/external mutation and `AI_PR_DELIVERY=off` (the prompt also states local-only scope), captures raw events/stderr/session statistics, records a content-hash manifest, runs declared post-checks without a shell, and grades deterministic completion/mutation/safety evidence. Post-checks must leave the disposable workspace byte-for-byte unchanged.

It writes `summary.json` plus `summary.md` and returns exit code 2 for deterministic failure or rejected baseline comparison. Suite and immutable-input fingerprints plus model/thinking/trial/timeout/Pi/Node metadata prevent comparison across different benchmark contracts or run settings. Tool starts/ends are reduced to call/error/duplicate/verification/repair/retry/compaction metrics; official session stats supply tokens and cost. Qualitative rubric items remain explicitly `UNSCORED`, so a mechanically clean result is only `QUALITATIVE_REVIEW_REQUIRED`, never automatic promotion. That review may be performed by a separate blinded model/agent; ordinary workflow completion does not wait for a person.

Model calls can incur cost and may transmit copied repository content to the selected provider. Run only with an approved model/provider and suitable data classification. For stronger isolation, launch the evaluation from the container/VM policy described in `SECURITY.md`.

The test-economy cases cover three different decisions: `copy-edit-without-test-churn` requires the exact requested documentation correction and rejects extra files; `already-covered-behavior` requires an unchanged tree and runs the existing below-tier test; `tiered-pricing-regression` still requires a new defect-sensitive boundary regression. Review traces to judge whether the agent itself selected and executed proportionate evidence: grader checks run after the agent and do not prove its reasoning or tool use. Static phrase checks on instructions are not a substitute for these model trials.

The executable `tiered-pricing-regression` fixture validates test usefulness rather than test existence: the final test must pass, the same test must fail when the disposable workspace temporarily restores the immutable fixture baseline source, and the final source is restored in a `finally` block. This proof does not create or read a Git commit.

## Comparable inputs and isolated Git

The runner and post-checks remove inherited `GIT_*` redirects and set Git's discovery ceiling at the disposable workspace parent. An ordinary nested Git command cannot accidentally discover the source checkout. This is accident isolation, not a sandbox: explicit paths, interpreters and modified environment variables still require the OS/container boundary.

`evals/cases.json` declares exact `harnessTreatmentPaths` (only `.pi/**` accepts a wildcard). Everything else in the materialized manifest is immutable comparison input. Per-trial `input-manifest.json` records content, file-mode and symlink-target hashes without following links. Source/grader/fixture drift, changed treatment declarations, missing fingerprints and missing required median metrics reject a comparison. Rebaseline old summaries; do not backfill fabricated hashes or zero-valued metrics.

When comparing an earlier harness against this runner, use the **same revised evaluator and fixture files in both copies**, then vary only declared treatment files. Do not compare old and new graders and attribute the difference to the harness. The current case set is a starter: most cases require qualitative review and do not execute a complete production app. A dry run proves suite structure and copyability, not model performance.

For a budget model, start with a few representative client tasks, then repeat baseline/candidate trials with the same approved model and settings. Include a real persistence/reload journey, an authorization rejection, and a rendered mobile/RTL journey where those are client requirements. A model that fails a required capability is unsuitable for that task until a faithful fallback proves it. Never lower acceptance or promise AAA output to compensate. Model changes require a separate qualification run, not a mixed-model harness comparison.
