description: Implement one visually exceptional, fully functional frontend slice from the accepted product and design contracts
argument-hint: "<accepted UI slice or journey>"
---

Build this frontend slice completely:

$ARGUMENTS

1. Read `AGENTS.md`, `docs/PRODUCT.md`, `docs/DESIGN.md`, `docs/QUALITY.md`, and relevant architecture/code/tests.
2. Load `frontend-design`, `browser-qa`, and `verification-routing`.
3. Record any new explicit user style/color choices in `docs/DESIGN.md` before coding; preserve the rest of the accepted direction and use its canonical token source. Label proposed details separately from owner choices. Establish 3–7 observable acceptance criteria covering the critical journey, required states, design thesis/signature, responsive behavior, accessibility, and performance evidence.
4. Inspect supplied reference images and the current rendered baseline when one exists, following `browser-qa`'s capability/delivery checks. Reuse sound components/tokens; update the design contract first if implementation requires a material visual decision not already accepted.
5. Implement one real end-to-end slice. No placeholder actions, fake persistence, dead controls, screenshot-only mockups, or decorative data.
6. Verify narrowly while building. Exercise realistic content and required loading, empty, error, success, disabled, focus, and permission states.
7. Through the real browser, run the product pass, then capture and actually inspect the minimum desktop/mobile/demanding-state images. Use focused crops for fine detail, run the studio pass from the visual-quality rubric, and re-capture affected states after fixes. A path or image count is not proof of inspection.
8. Use a fresh read-only `reviewer` context for the final studio pass only when subagents are available and the independent pass is justified; otherwise do a separate rubric pass yourself. Fix evidence-backed issues; use at most two critique/repair rounds.
9. Run the feature verification lane once. Map every acceptance criterion to exact evidence.

Return the design direction delivered, signature element, hard-gate status, craft score, browser evidence, checks, main files, and remaining risk.
